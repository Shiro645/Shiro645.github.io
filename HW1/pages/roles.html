                efficiently, stably, and securely.

            <h3>Ressource Management</h3>
            <p>
                One of the main roles of an OS is the management of computer hardware resources.
                It decides which program uses which resource, when and for how long.
                <br>
                This concerns in particular:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>the CPU (processor): program execution time</li>
                <li>random access memory (RAM): memory space allocated to each application
                </li>
                <li> the inputs/outputs: keyboard, mouse, screen, discs, printers
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>
                The OS acts as an arbiter: it prevents one program from monopolizing all resources or interfering with
                others. This ensures the stability of the system and avoids software conflicts.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-block" id="interface">
            <h3>Interface between hardware and software</h3>
            <p>
                The operating system acts as a bridge between hardware and programs.
                Applications do not communicate directly with the processor, memory or peripherals: they pass through
                the OS.
            </p>
            <br>
            Thanks to this abstraction:
            <ul>
                <li> the developers do not need to know the technical details of the hardware
                </li>
                <li> the same program can run on different machines
                </li>
                <li> the material is used in a safer and controlled way.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>
                Without this interface, each application would have to manage the hardware itself, making software much
                more complex to develop.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-block" id="multitasking">
            <h3>Multitasking</h3>
            <p>
                A modern operating system allows multitasking, i.e. running several programs at the same time.
                <br>
                In reality:
                the processor alternates very quickly between tasks,
                each program has the illusion of running continuously,
                the OS plans the order and execution time of each process.
                <br>
                This mechanism allows, for example:
                to listen to music while browsing the Internet,
                to download a file while another program is running or
                to use several applications without blocking the system.
